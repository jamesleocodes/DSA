# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Each problem is organized in its own directory with a detailed explanation and implementation. For basic understanding of time complexity and space complexity can be found in this [article.](https://medium.com/@mr.zawmyowin.physics/understanding-time-and-space-complexity-in-a-simple-way-bd3ddf49c677)

## Problems

### Two-Pointer Technique Problems
Problems that can be efficiently solved using the two-pointer technique:

1. **Reverse String**
   - **Problem**: Reverse a string in-place with O(1) extra memory
   - **Directory**: `reverse_string/`
   - **Solution**: Two-Pointer Technique
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

2. **Squares of a Sorted Array**
   - **Problem**: Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order
   - **Directory**: `squares_of_a_sorted-array/`
   - **Solution**: Two-Pointer Technique
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n)

3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
   - **Problem**: Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place and return the number of unique elements
   - **Directory**: `remove_duplicate/`
   - **Solution**: Two-Pointer Technique
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
